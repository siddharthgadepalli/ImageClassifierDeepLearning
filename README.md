# Flower Name Prediction Using Deep Learning in PyTorch


This repository contains a deep learning code from PyTorch that trains on a image dataset of flowers and predicts the name of the flower based on the image.

Caveats:

Because the dataset is large, consistent training over large epochs requires connecting to a powerful GPU cluster that can process 1000s of images while training. Built in PyTorch pretrained models: DenseNet121 and Resnet18 are used to train the model and then that model is loaded from saved directory to run prediction probabilities.

Libraries Used:

Torch, Torchvision

Pytorch: nn (neural net)

Transform, models, datasets, 

matplotlib

numpy
